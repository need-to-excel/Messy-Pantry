# Messy-Pantry

## Description 

Welcome to the Messy Pantry app. The only app that will give you food, wine and GIFs! This app will help you find the most delishious dish, perfect wine and silly GIFs for all your choices. We wanted to build this app because a lot of people get demotivated when thinking about what to cook for dinner. Our solution is to give you an app that takes the guess work out. For example, if you need inspo for the chicken you have in the fridge, simply type in chicken and all our recommendations will present themselves to you! 

We built this project because we wanted to give users an easy time looking for the recipes that will be tasty, easy and paired with the best wine! 

With this project we learnt how to work as a team. This was cruicial for our project, by respecting and commincating with each other we were able to get a fully functioning app working. This is refelcted by having a clean and professional looking landing page, followed by working APIs that fetch your recipes, wines and GIFs. This is further reflected by having your searches stored in your local storage and showing up as buttons to launch you right back to where you left off. 

I think that this project makes us standout because we have had a fun spin on a recipe app and implented something that makes it more fun instead of just showing you the recipe and wine. The GIFs we have used here give the user a fun and rememorable expereience which will boost users to come back more! 

## Installation 

Use the deployed URL at the top of the page and open up to the landing page. Which should look like the below:

If you are in Github this will be a link in the README.md file. If on you code editor go to the readme file and click the link to take you to the website. 

After you've loaded the page you can use the search bar to take you to the second page, demonstated below:

## Usage 

This should be used for when inspiration is low for food, when you want a great wine pairing and a good laugh with a GIF. Simply type in something you want like 'pasta' and we will give you pasta recipes, great wine that will go with the dish and a fun GIF. You will see this reflect back to you in the local storage and under out tab called 'search history' so if you come back, you won't even need to try and remember what you searched before. It will already be there!
